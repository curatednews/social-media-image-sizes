# Social Media Image Sizes

Hi, this is a list of recommended image formats for various social media platforms.


> All image formats will eventually be on this page. But for now, check out the `data.json` file. Otherwise, access the raw file via your code at [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-duck/social-media-image-sizes/master/data.json)

## Usage

The idea is to use the `data.json` file as it gets updated. All entries go into the "data" key.

An entry looks like this:
```
  {
    "type":"instagram:story",
    "width":"1080",
    "height":"1920",
    "ratio":"0.562"
  }
```

Below, you will find every type of image format followed by their `type` attribute.
Then it's up to you to parse this :)


### Instagram

* Profile image / type:`instagram:profile`


### Twitter

* Profile image / type:`twitter:profile`


### Facebook


### Google Business
